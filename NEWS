     - Nuked OPL3 by Nuke.YKT (a new default one)
     - WoodyOPL from DOSBox (sounds good too)
   - 49716Hz added as a preset sample rate, because the sample rate affects
     the pitch of some instruments, and this makes them sound more true to the
     real chip (e.g. Keen 6 metal.imf)

     support this anymore)

Changes for in_adlib version 1.8.2 (2010-04-23) (Wraithverge)
   - Added support for Adam Nielsen's Synth Wrapper, which can be configured
     via "winamp.ini" and/or the GUI.  A big thanks goes out to Adam for his
     help in us getting it to work properly in the plugin!  As a result of
     our efforts, two new options have been added:
     - Harmonic Effect: This option fully utilizes a process that pitch-
       shifts OPL2 data very slightly on one channel in order to produce a
       psuedo-stereo Phaser-like effect from a mono source.  Two copies of
       Mr. Satoh's emulator are generated for it to accomplish this goal.
       Note that a prerequisite for this option to work is that "Emulator 1"
       must be selected as the chosen emulator.
     - Dueling Synths: This option utilizes the OPL2 Synth Wrapper's ability
       to host two separate streams of OPL2 data simultaneously and output
       the combination as 16-Bits Stereo PCM data.  One copy each of Mr.
       Satoh's and Mr. Silverman's emulators are generated for it to
       accomplish this goal, with them being heard respectively on the left
       and right channels.  Note that a prerequisite for this option to work
       is that "Emulator 2" must be selected as the chosen emulator.

   * Changes for the AdPlug core library 2.2.1:
     ------------------------------------------
     - Bug fixes:
       - CMF: Fixed crash on v1.0 files.
              Fixed a memory leak.
              Clear OPL3 mode on playback to avoid a previous song affecting
              the instruments.
       - DRO: Updated DROv1 player to handle early files with a slightly
              different header.  Fixes random bytes sent at the end of early
              DROv1 files.

Changes for in_adlib version 1.8.1 (2010-03-14) (Wraithverge)
